This package implements text mining methods to aid in the exploration of text data and grouping of records. Examples are provided in the context of the [NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS)](https://asrs.arc.nasa.gov) narratives, however the methods found here can be reused in other domains.

## Getting started

To get started, please see the [Online ASRS Record Query Formatting](http://itm0.shidler.hawaii.edu/kaona/articles/parsing_asrs_records.html) vignette to understand how to parse ASRS data.
